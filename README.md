Thank you!

## 🖼 Project Overview

This read-me outlines the work I have done for the Founders and Coders (FAC) application process, for the 2022 cohort.
The website and prompts fulfil the requirements set by FAC.
Hopefully this is of some help to you if you're also thinking of applying 🥰
I liked looking at former applicants' processes too.
I tend to write a lot, so this is almost a personal diary. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections!

## 📅 Application Timeline

**📱 November 1 2021 - How I learnt about FAC**

I started telling people I was learning coding and wanted to make a career change in October. My boyfriend's best friend, who
changed careers from Psychology to software development tells me about Founders and Coders, which his company hires from.
I look it up and FAC are accepting applications! The downside is that I only have a month left to apply.

**🤓 November 5-15 2021 - freeCodeCamp**

Started grinding through the basic HTML portion of the freeCodeCamp requirement. I had already been coding for almost a month
at this point, so it was fairly straightforward. I still learnt a lot though! I do it every day up until November 15, where I
finished basic Javascript and took 3 weeks' break to work on the prompts FAC set.

**💢 November 18 2021 - Prompts are hard**

Finished prompt 1 and 2, but immediately get stuck on prompt 3. Turns out my coding programme was not working, not my code (cry). Take a 2 week break to relearn the basics of JS and forms, and work on other coding projects which helped.

**🎄 December 2-7 2021 - Looming deadline**

Came back and finished prompt 3 and 4 after I changed code editors. Prompt 8: objects was pretty hard and I tried a lot of different ways to code it.

**🎊 December 7-9 2021 - Completing the website**

Finished the JS prompts and sketched out how I wanted the website to look. I looked on Pinterest for colour scheme ideas and font pairings. Coding the HTML/CSS was fairly easy, but had to do quite a bit of code refactoring for my quiz feature.
Tested the site on Chrome, Safari (iOS) and Android Chrome.
I finished the application on the site after answering the questions, where I wrote an obscene amount of text.
I'm working on being more concise with my responses!
The deadline is 10th December 9pm GMT, so I finished a day early and celebrated with some curry omurice 💗

**Comments on the timeline**

I am the type of person who is extremely motivated by deadlines; the closer I get the harder I work.
The breaks I took were pretty long, I'm very new to coding and had to learn so much while doing the prompts. It was really great! I did more than the required freeCodeCamp modules and it was very helpful: RegEx and functional programming was necessary. It's probably best to submit applications earlier though!
