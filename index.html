           <div class="lol">
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Trina Yau. I am a pharmacist and I have only just
          started my coding journey. I was born in Singapore but I currently live in a quiet area of NW
          London with my boyfriend and my Pomsky puppy, Mimi. I used to spend lots of time blogging online, which
          is where I first discovered my love for CSS and web design. These days, I tend to take it a bit easier
          and spend my time reading, writing and unashamedly running my puppy's instagram. We have a whole puppy support network 
          because of it now! After attending university and
          qualifying as a pharmacist, I started working for a veterinary
          pharmaceuticals company as a project manager, where my love for animals was not only supported, but encouraged.
        </br> </br>
        I was hired as the company's first
          employee and got to attend lots of conferences to learn more about the companion
          animal health market, which was an entirely new industry to me.
          I love animals and enjoyed talking to vets about which medicines would
          provide the most benefit to our pets here in the UK. My most interesting moment has got to be
          asking a manufacturer for a palatability report for a cat medicine, and receiving a report
          where an employee essentially lured 10 random cats on the street with a spoonful of chicken-flavoured solution.
          That, and naming the subsequent product PhatKat (it helps thin cats gain weight).
          <br/><br/>Two years on, I still enjoy many
          aspects of my current work, such as the logical problem-solving
          required to deal with drug development issues, coupled with the
          creative thinking needed to market new drugs. I have also been
          fortunate enough to work in China to understand good manufacturing
          processes and be exposed to different working cultures and people.
      </br> </br>
          When lockdown hit, all of my projects came to a screeching halt as the medicines authorities rightfully dedicated all of their
          resources to medicines and vaccines against COVID. It felt as if I was in limbo for a while, and some of my projects still are! 
          Feeling slightly frustrated with the slow pace of the industry, I have been working on a personal project that I hope will
          take my career in an entirely new direction— learning how to code.

       <h2>Why Pharmacy to Tech? 💊</h2></br>
       <p>I first became interested in coding after being inspired by a close friend 
         who built a career in the technology industry in just two years, from a position 
         of not knowing how to code at all (go Sarah!). <br/></br>
         After dedicating my evenings to learning how to code, 
         I found myself enjoying the process and committing increasing time to it. 
         I love the logical nature of coding and found a new satisfaction in applying this to solving 
         problems and creating visual outputs that are unique to me. The duality of using logic and personal 
         creativity in my approach made completing my projects all the more rewarding which spurred the idea of a career transition. 
         <br/></br>From a career standpoint, the tech industry is fast-paced with great opportunities across all sectors, which allows for infinite possibilities on the types of projects I could encounter. 
         A tech career would also combine aspects I enjoy from my work, such as the creative and problem-solving aspects, 
         with what I want in the future: to work collaboratively with peers in a challenging and innovative environment.
        </br></br>After deciding to learn how to code, I made a social media account to document my learning. I also
           didn't hesitate to post about the issues I encountered while trying to debug my code! 
           Unexpectedly, members of the coding community reached out to me, and what followed were group meetings where we discussed problems and design tips, 
           with more experienced developers occasionally helping. I felt an effortless sense of community and 
           belonging while learning to code, and the discussions inspired me to challenge myself with more complex programming, 
           such as my current project, an interactive weather app with real-time data from APIs. Since then I have had many more ideas for projects that I would like to turn into real code.
         </br></br>In the future, when I gain more experience as a developer, I would love to mentor students from all backgrounds and 
           abilities how to code as my friends in the online community have patiently helped me.

      <h2 class="fac-h2">Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
    </br>
      <p>
        It has been almost two months since I've first started learning how to code, and I've realised that I needed to work harder and build my technical knowledge before I can transition to a career in tech. I feel that Founders and Coders would be the best teacher for me to achieve my goal. Your programme stands out to me because of the opportunity to learn web development as part of a peer-led training course and the support available in finding a career in tech afterwards. I would jump at the chance to pair code with fellow self-directed learners in the course on collaborative projects and overcome obstacles in a co-operative and supportive environment.

<br><br>As the first person in my family to go on to higher education, I wished I had the benefit of a mentor in my academic journey, which led me to mentor other young trainee pharmacists. And as a young female pharmacist working in the very traditional and regulated environment of the medicines industry, I have often felt my voice went unheard, and have had to advocate for myself. Both of these experiences have taught me that that allyship is truly important, and I have been fortunate enough to meet supportive colleagues and friends. I recognise my own privilege, having attended university, and I have unfortunately also faced discrimination for things beyond my control. I believe I will truly thrive in a more inclusive and diverse environment, while supporting and being supported by motivated colleagues. I would therefore love to be part of the programme run by Founders and Coders, which prioritises and champions diversity and creates a space where supporting marginalised groups is a core principle, as shown by your commitment to allyship in your application section.  I hope to bring a unique perspective and a friendly voice into the 2022 cohort, as well as a love for design and Javascript. The Founders and Coders Programme resonates deeply with my professional goals and personal values. For me, it represents an opportunity to get better at what I truly enjoy, and I feel excited to potentially take part in the future!
