           <div class="lol">
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Trina Yau. I am a pharmacist and I have only just
          started my coding journey. I currently live in a quiet area of NW
          London with my boyfriend and my puppy. After attending university and
          qualifying as a pharmacist, I started working for a veterinary
          pharmaceuticals company as a project manager, which is where I
          currently work. 
        </br> </br>
        I was excited to be hired as the company's first
          employee and got to attend lots of conferences to learn more about the companion
          animal health market, which was an entirely new industry to me.
          I love animals and enjoyed talking to vets about which medicines would
          provide the most benefit to our pets here in the UK.
          <br/><br/>Two years on, I still love many
          things about my current work, such as the logical problem-solving
          required to deal with drug development issues, coupled with the
          creative thinking needed to market new drugs. I have also been
          fortunate enough to work in China to understand good manufacturing
          processes and be exposed to different working cultures and people.
      </br> </br>
          Alongside my regular work in veterinary medicines for the last few
          months, I have been working on a personal project that I hope will
          take my career in an entirely new directionâ€” learning how to code.

       <h2>Why Pharmacy to Tech? ðŸ’Š</h2></br>
       <p>I first became interested in coding after being inspired by a close friend 
         who built a career in the technology industry in just two years, from a position 
         of not knowing how to code at all (go Sarah!). <br/></br>
         After dedicating my evenings to learning how to code, 
         I found myself enjoying the process and committing increasing time to it. 
         I love the logical nature of coding and found a new satisfaction in applying this to solving 
         problems and creating visual outputs that are unique to me. The duality of using logic and personal 
         creativity in my approach made completing my projects all the more rewarding which spurred the idea of a career transition. 
         <br/></br>From a career standpoint, the tech industry is fast-paced with great opportunities across all sectors, which allows for infinite possibilities on the types of projects I could encounter. 
         A tech career would also combine aspects I enjoy from my work, such as the creative and problem-solving aspects, 
         with what I want in the future: to work collaboratively with peers in a challenging and innovative environment.
        </br></br>After deciding to learn how to code, I made a social media account to document my learning. I also
           didn't hesitate to post about the issues I encountered while trying to debug my code! 
           Unexpectedly, members of the coding community reached out to me, and what followed were group meetings where we discussed problems and design tips, 
           with more experienced developers occasionally helping. I felt an effortless sense of community and 
           belonging while learning to code, and the discussions inspired me to challenge myself with more complex programming, 
           such as my current project, an interactive weather app with real-time data from APIs. 
         </br></br>In the future, when I gain more experience as a developer, I would love to teach students from all backgrounds and 
           abilities how to code as others have patiently helped me. 
        </br></br> Moreover, I've discovered that I genuinely love the process of coding, in particular design and building features in Javascript.
